# 4MIDable framework Agent Example
This is an example of an agent implementation for the 4MIDable framework.

In this case, the agent starts up, connects to a switch and waits for input. 

To run the example, use the following command:
`go run agent-example.go`

You will require the 4MIDable framework library, and its dependencies installed.
These should be fetched automatically when installing the 4MIDable framework.
